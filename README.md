# Investigating A DataSet.
Investigting A Dataset: Project for Udacity Data Analytics Nano Degree.
## Project Overview
In this project, we have to analyze a dataset and then communicate our findings about it. We will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make your analysis easier.
## What needs to be done
For the this project, I will conduct my own data analysis and create a file to share my findings. I will start by taking a look at the dataset and brainstorm what questions I could answer using it. Then i will use pandas and NumPy to answer the questions that I am most interested in, and create a report sharing the answers.
